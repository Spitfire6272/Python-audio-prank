A very simple python prank that plays a mp3 file at max volume in the background, in such a way it can only be closed with task manager. It is designed to work on school laptops, which do not allow the installation of python packages and libraries, so it functions using nothing but Windows OS. 
It works by creating a VLC process in the background, that cannot be seen nor interacted with. Only a person who is in on the prank would know to kill the process. It uses a loop to spam Windows volume up API calls, so that it plays at max volume and the user cannot lower the volume. You should adjust the variables mp3_file and vlc_path as required. The included mp3 is Wannabe by the Spice Girls. 
Recommended use is to first put all relevant files into the same directory, but include bogus files as a diversion from the payload. Then compile the script with "python -m py_compile main.py", to obfuscate code and execute it instantly. Enjoy watching your peers panic as their computer blasts Spice girls at max volume in class, and donsn't listen to their commands. 
Update: Unfortunately, my MP3 will not upload, because of DMCA, so you will have to download your own and edit the variable to match its name. You can still download the mp3 I used and rename it to "ping" here: https://archive.org/details/spice-girls-spice_202203
